    #Architecture

The app uses a simple and modular structure with separation of concerns.

- **State Management**: `Provider` package is used for managing state across the app such as login session and bookmarked articles.
- **Persistence**: `shared_preferences` is used to store login status and bookmarks locally.
- **API Layer**: `http` package is used for fetching news data from a public news API (e.g., NewsAPI.org).
- **Routing**: Flutter's built-in `Navigator` is used for screen navigation and `BottomNavigationBar` for tabs.ðŸ§© Packages Used
